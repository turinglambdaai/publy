# Publy CLI and self-hosting manual

**English** · [简体中文](guide.zh-CN.md) · [Agent CLI contract](agent-cli.md)

Publy renders Markdown locally and delivers article drafts or image-post cards through a server to official WeChat APIs. A successful draft delivery is not a public post or mass-send. Available APIs depend on your actual account permissions.

Public hosted registration and payment are **not open**. Start with local rendering and your own server; do not send credentials to an old hosted URL. The server disables the historical `/purchase`, `/order/:id`, `/lookup` and `/pay/xunhupay/notify` routes by default (`CHECKOUT_NOT_AVAILABLE`). An explicit `payments.enableLegacyCheckout: true` with `payments.provider: "manual"` is reserved for isolated owner-controlled tests and is **not** permission to operate public billing. Missing Alipay/XunhuPay configuration never silently falls back to manual selling. Hosted checkout must move to Commerce/Permit and pass the merchant admission and authorization gates in [#17](https://github.com/turlamai/publy/issues/17). See the [user guide](USER-GUIDE.md) for availability, privacy and recovery limits.

## Install from source

Use Node.js 22+ and pnpm, as declared by the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/turlamai/publy.git
cd publy
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm -r build
node packages/cli/dist/index.js --help
```

The commands below use `publy` as shorthand for the source-built CLI entry. **Publy no longer distributes new CLI versions via the npm Registry.** The standalone installer is not available yet; see the [no-npm distribution plan](distribution.md). Until it passes platform acceptance, this is a developer source-build workflow and requires Node.js/pnpm on the build machine, not a recommended end-user install.

## Check any saved Markdown before delivery

Use the original file from Typora or an Obsidian vault. Both use the same
Markdown parser and asset preflight; no additional editor integrations are
planned. In the development CLI:

```sh
publy check "/path/to/article.md"
publy check "/path/to/article.md" --json
```

This is an **offline, read-only-source** check: image/cover path validation,
card-section lint, and a JSON result for agents. Input errors exit 2,
preflight problems exit 4, success exits 0. It never contacts the server or
submits a WeChat draft. Typora source-relative image folders and local
`typora-root-url` are supported. For complete supported/unsupported source
types and clean-install goals, see [editor-independent workflows](editor-workflows.md).

**Media gate:** `publy check` and `publy publish` both reject a missing
local image or cover, an unrenderable SVG/formula, or a remote / embedded
data image that would not be uploaded as WeChat material. Download such
pictures into the note's local asset folder first. Browser HTML previews
use a restrictive CSP blocking automatic remote image/script/network loads;
local images display as embedded data. Links navigate only on user action. The CLI does not print
signed remote-image URL query parameters in its errors. A missing article
cover (unless a local body image exists) or an image post with no images
also blocks draft submission before any network request.

**Image-card preview:** for a Markdown file with `mode: cards`,
`publy preview post.md --no-open --out cards-review.html` renders actual
PNG cards with the same rasterizer used for a WeChat image-post draft.
It embeds their bytes into a local HTML preview with the caption, displays
lint problems, and does **not** contact a server or download fonts. If the
bundled subset cannot display the text, it fails locally rather than
silently fetching a remote font or pretending the draft is ready.
The source document remains unchanged; no draft is submitted.

## Preview before delivery

```sh
publy preview article.md
publy preview article.md --no-open --out preview.html  # offline, images embedded
publy render article.md -o out.html
publy theme ls
publy theme preview claude
```

Keep source Markdown and media. `preview` opens the local result; `render` writes HTML. Themes may be installed packages, so review their provenance before using them with private material.

Article frontmatter supports `title`, `cover`, `theme`, `author` and `digest`. A cover can come from frontmatter, `--cover` or the first image; missing required media is an error. Account defaults can be overridden with the documented command flags; `publy --help` and subcommand help remain the exact flag reference.

## Image cards

Use `mode: cards`, a caption, and 3–9 sections containing a cover, content and ending. Preview the resulting deck before delivery:

```markdown
---
title: A test deck
mode: cards
theme: naive
caption: A non-sensitive test
---
## cover
A test deck
## point
One useful idea
Check the rendered result before sending.
## ending
Thanks for reading
```

```sh
publy card post.md --preview
```

Card validation can refuse an invalid count or caption length. Standard image posts use `type: image`; review the Chinese manual and command help for the full input contract. Rendering does not imply the account can publish every WeChat message type.

## Configure your server

The delivery server needs a stable outbound IP whitelisted for the intended account. First prove a single-account private pilot; follow [operations](operations.md) for its actual state and backup layout. Do not expose an unauthenticated listener to the public internet.

A legacy static configuration has this shape, referenced by `PUBLY_SERVER_CONFIG`:

```json
{
  "port": 8081,
  "apiKey": "<random-server-api-key>",
  "accounts": [{"name": "test", "appId": "wx...", "appSecret": "<server-only-secret>"}]
}
```

This example stores a secret in a restricted file; it does not provide encryption at rest. Never commit a real file. Managed binding/database paths may handle secrets differently and must be checked against the selected implementation. Reload the server using your process manager after a configuration change.

For a source build the server entry is `packages/server/dist/index.js`. Use a service manager and authenticated HTTPS or a private tunnel for remote access. A localhost-only test can use HTTP without transmitting secrets over a public network.

## Configure the client and deliver one draft

```sh
publy config set server https://your-server.example
publy config set api_key <random-server-api-key>
publy account add test --app-id wx... --theme claude
publy account list
publy publish article.md --account test
publy history
```

Client configuration is stored under `~/.publy/config.json`; it contains the server API key. `media_dirs` configures local attachment lookup. Keep credentials out of screenshots and logs. Never send AppSecret through an issue or place it in a URL.

**Server replay conflict:** if a client reuses a key for a different
account, title, HTML, media bytes, cover or scheduled draft, the Publy
server now returns `409 IDEMPOTENCY_CONFLICT` instead of pretending the old
draft is the new one. Inspect the previous result before creating a distinct
submission. Historical records without full fingerprints retain only their
original account/title/type compatibility check; new records persist the
complete body fingerprint.

**Request identity (CLI + Obsidian):** Publy now hashes the complete submitted
draft, including target account, full HTML, media bytes, cover and schedule.
Different text of the same length or an updated image with the same filename
must never be silently treated as a duplicate. An unchanged retry reuses its
key. The key identifies the *submission*, not a promise of exactly-once
delivery: a crash after remote acceptance but before durable recording can
still leave an **unknown** outcome; reconcile using the original key and
inspect the official drafts before deciding whether to retry.

Confirm the returned outcome in WeChat’s draft backend. On a network failure the outcome is unknown, not failed: query the original request identity with `publy publish-result <key>` (the failed command prints it), then retry the same request — the server reconciles against its idempotency record instead of duplicating. Interrupted scheduled jobs never auto-rerun after a restart; re-admit them with `publy jobs retry <id>`. The source has token caching, media deduplication, bounded duplicate handling and queued jobs, but their existence is not a qualified guarantee of exactly-once delivery or crash recovery. Scheduling via `--at` needs a running, recovered server and its actual timezone/queue semantics checked first.

## Obsidian

Install the plugin assets from the release you selected, configure the same authenticated server and preview one disposable note. The plugin supports article/card preview, rich-text copying and delivery. Source notes remain in your vault; server-side copies, metadata and retry state follow the selected deployment’s storage behavior.

## Troubleshooting

- Authentication failure: verify server address and key without posting either publicly.
- WeChat IP error: confirm the server’s actual outbound IP and the account whitelist, not its browser-facing domain alone.
- WeChat credential error: check AppID/AppSecret on the server and rotate exposed secrets at WeChat.
- Unknown delivery outcome: inspect remote drafts and history before retrying; preserve redacted error codes.
- Missing images/fonts: preview locally, check media paths and build dependencies before contacting a server.

## Recovery and support

Back up source/media separately from server configuration, SQLite state, history, jobs and decryption material. Do not copy an active SQLite file unsafely; use a consistent snapshot or stop the writer. Restore to an isolated server and verify old credentials/jobs before reconnecting external delivery. See [operations](operations.md), [privacy status](privacy.md), [service status](terms.md), and [support](USER-GUIDE.md#get-help).
